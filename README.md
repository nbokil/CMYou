# CMYou

## Synopsis

CMYou is a web application that makes the organization search and community involvement process for students at Carnegie Mellon University better and efficient. Using the Bridge API, the application allows students to create user profiles and view recommended organizations based on their interests. They can view favorited organizations on a student dashboard page and visualizations of time commitment. RAs and Community Planners can also receive access to view student interests by dorm to better plan events on-campus. This application was designed for 67-475: Innovation in Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University.
