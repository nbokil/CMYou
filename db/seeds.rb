Further, to provide a support group for those in their times of need and to encourage the making of successful women.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><strong>&hearts; </strong>History<strong> &hearts;</strong></strong><br /> alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall of 1989 and was recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. The founding sisters - Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan - dedicated themselves to establishing a strong and lasting organization which would provide Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system. Soon after being recognized by the College Panhellenic Association the founding sisters brought together a diverse group of women who shared with them the goals of sisterhood, scholarship, and leadership. These ideals were to later set the foundation for alpha Kappa Delta Phi's purpose.<br /> <br /> The love and generosity that each member had for the organization was instrumental to the growth of alpha Kappa Delta Phi's reputation as a sorority, as well as to the forging of unbreakable friendships. The sisterhood has since then spread to prominent university campuses across the country. To meet the needs of the growing sisterhood, the National Board of alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established in May of 1993 at the National Convention in Santa Barbara, California.<br /> <br /> It is the sincere wish of the founding sisters and the charter class that alpha Kappa Delta Phi continue to promote Asian Awareness in the community and leadership opportunities for women by providing each women with the resources, unique sisterly support and understanding to achieve her goals in life. <br /> <br /> To find out more, please visit our national website at www.akdphi.org.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><strong>&hearts; </strong>Purpose <strong>&hearts;</strong></strong><br /> The purpose of this Asian-American interest sorority is to promote sisterhood, scholarship, leadership, and Asian American awareness in the University and in the community, while encouraging the expression of the individual.

Built on truth, self-sacrifice, and friendship, our sisterhood goes beyond college, lasting a lifetime. Many of our graduates enjoy attending alumni chapter events and meeting other sisters from over 130 collegiate chapters around the world!</p>\r\n<p>In Alpha Tau, sisters care for one another and support each other&rsquo;s individual growth so that every sister makes the most of her college years.&nbsp; Our sisters are dedicated to making indelible contributions to our community. Many serve as Community and Resident Assistants (CA/RA) for dorms, Orientation Counselors/Leaders, research assistants, and leaders for student organizations and honor societies, just to name a few!</p>\r\n<p>Put these uniquely talented and passionate women together, and we achieve a lot. This past spring, we participated in Greek Sing, placing 2<sup>nd</sup> for our take on &ldquo;Wicked&rdquo; and 1<sup>st</sup> in Philanthropy for raising over $16,000 for Our Clubhouse. Other highlights include placing 3<sup>rd</sup> for our Booth on <em>Where the While Things Are</em> and receiving 4 Greek Awards from CMU.</p>\r\n<p>But our most prized achievement so far has been raising money and awareness for St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital, our national philanthropy since 1999. Last year, Tri Delta chapters pledged to raise $60 million in 10 years to help St. Jude in offering free treatment to kids with cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Today our chapter is proud to have raised half of our goal for 2015 with our fundraisers, such as Peace. Love. &amp; Tie Dye and Delta House of Pancakes (DHOP).</p>\r\n<p>As President, I am honored to lead a group of women who challenge me to be my best self.

In the fall of 1943, the Executive Board visited Carnegie Mellon's campus, and on February 12, 1944, officially granted a charter for Delta Delta Delta. On April 15, 1944, the Alpha Tau chapter of Delta Delta Delta was formally installed.<br /> <br /> Delta Delta Delta is currently 93 members strong, with active participation from alumni and advisers. In 2009, Alpha Tau relocated onto the Greek Quadrangle and moved into their current house.</p>\r\n<p><em>Nationally Founded:</em>&nbsp;November 27th, 1888</p>\r\n<p><em>Alpha Tau Chapter Founded:</em>&nbsp;April 15th, 1944</p>\r\n<p><em>Colors:</em>&nbsp;Silver + Gold + Cerulean Blue</p>\r\n<p><em>Symbols:</em>&nbsp;Pearl, Pine Tree, Pansy, Dolphin, Poseidon, Trident</p>\r\n<p><em>Motto:</em>&nbsp;\"Let us steadfastly love one another.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Sisterhood</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In Tri Delta we participate in a variety of fun events throughout the year. Every fall, we host a Crush Party where sisters and their guests get to dance the night away at a local restaurant. In the spring, we have our annual formal, the Stars and Crescent Ball. We also attend a Founder&rsquo;s Day celebration in November with the University of Pittsburgh and Allegheny College chapters of Tri Delta as well as our Pittsburgh alumni chapter. Our sisterhood retreat every fall is always a blast!</p>\r\n<p>Our regular events include the weekly Delta Date, where two sisters are randomly paired up together and go on a fun date! We also have weekly Delta Bondings, where a bunch of sisters do an activity together, whether it be going to a sister's recital, baking treats for the house, or having a workout session in the basement. Our monthly Delta Dinner in the house is essential for sharing our love of food with one another. Each dinner is hosted by a group of sisters who volunteer to make their favorite dish!</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the year, we hold a variety of events with other fraternities, sororities, and outside organizations on campus. Each semester, we create an Intramural team (or two!) with another fraternity. We also partner with other student organizations for service and philanthropy events.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Service and Philanthropy</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em>National Philanthropy:</em>&nbsp;St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, for which Tri Delta is currently in a campaign to raise $60 million in 10 years nationally.</p>\r\n<p><em>Philanthropy&nbsp;Events:</em>&nbsp;Delta House of Pancakes (DHOP), Sincerely Yours Letter Writing Campaign, Dodge for a Cure Dodgeball Tournament, Pelt-a-Delta, Peace.

Over the past 133 years, Delta Gamma has grown and adapted to remain relevant to today&rsquo;s collegiate women. With 145 collegiate chapters and over 15,000 active collegiate members we are a leader in the Greek community. Delta Gamma offers to women of all ages a rich heritage based on principles of personal integrity, personal responsibility and intellectual honesty. Its primary purpose is to foster high ideals of friendship, promote educational and cultural interests, create a true sense of social responsibility, and develop the finest qualities of character.</p>\r\n<h3>FUN FACTS</h3>\r\n<p>Founders: Mary Comfort Leonard, Eva Webb Dodd, Anna Boyd Ellington&nbsp;<br /> Symbol: Anchor&nbsp;<br /> Motto: &ldquo;Do Good&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /> Colors: Bronze, Pink, and Blue&nbsp;<br /> Flower: Cream Colored Rose</p>\r\n<h3>DELTA GAMMA AT CMU</h3>\r\n<p>Delta Gammas at Carnegie Mellon are well-rounded, dedicated women who are passionate about being involved. As a result, sisters are an integral part of the Carnegie Mellon community and are a presence on campus. We are members of clubs and activities ranging from Society of Women Engineers to The Tartan to Habitat for Humanity to Varsity &amp; Intramural sports teams. We can be found working as tutors, doing research for professors, TAs, office assistants, and even Orientation Counselors. It is our mission to inspire the greater campus community, and not just the Greek Quad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_x_text\">\r\n<h3>\"DOING GOOD\"</h3>\r\nSticking true to our motto, Do Good, DG puts philanthropy and service hours as a high priority. Our national philanthropy - Service for Sight - is an organization that assists the visually impaired and raises awareness for vision health. Locally, the Beta Nu chapter regularly volunteers at the Shadyside Nursing Home to spend time with the elderly, many of whom&nbsp;suffer from visual impairment. In December, DGs volunteer at the&nbsp;Lion's Club Christmas Tree Sale, benefiting the Western Pennsylvania School for the blind, a chapter favorite.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> In addition to this work, the Beta Nu chapter has recently become very involved in Service for Sight: Joining Forces. This is a new branch of our national philanthropy that specifically benefits service men and women who are visually impaired. DGs participate in a wide variety of service events to benefit Joing Forces such as writing thank you cards to service men and women and donating clothing, blankets and other items to the local military base. Also, we hold service events with other sororities, fraternities, and campus organizations.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>PHILANTHROPY</h3>\r\nDelta Gamma&rsquo;s philanthropy is Service for Sight, a community effort for servicing the visually impaired or blind. To raise money for these efforts, Delta Gamma holds an annual basketball tournament, Anchor Slam, and a field day&nbsp;competition, Anchor Clanker. Both events draw big crowds and attract participants from all around the Pittsburgh community. Anchor Clanker, held every fall, is a competition where teams compete in field day&nbsp;activities varying from three-legged races, tug of war and an obstalce course. We recruit teams from different Greek organizations, sports teams, and campus organizations to participate. Besides eternal glory, the winner of the event receives a prize. Anchor Slam is our annual spring semester philanthropy event. This 5-player team basketball competition operates in a March Madness style - bracketed until the best two teams compete. Like Anchor Splash, all proceeds go to Service for Sight and the winning team receives prizes.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> With all of our efforts, Delta Gamma typically raises around $2,000 for charity. In addition to our large events, Delta Gamma sisters also work directly with students from the School for the Blind in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Every DG is required to complete five hours of community service each semester for Service for Sight and two additional community service hours.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>LEADERS ON CAMPUS</h3>\r\n<p>In Delta Gamma, we take pride in the leadership roles our sisters assume on campus. Many of our girls are Orientation Counselors, Teaching Assistants, Resident Advisors, Andrew Ambassadors, members of Rho Lambda Honor Society for Women, and members of Order of Omega National Honor Society! We also have sisters who serve on the executive boards of campus organizations like Bhangra in the Burgh, SIFE, 1000plus, Up &lsquo;til Dawn, and WRCT Radio - to name a few.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>DELTA GAMMA EVENTS</h3>\r\n<p>There is never a dull moment among the sisters of Delta Gamma, for when we are not in the middle of an event, there is another one right around the corner! After we welcome our new member class, our year of events kicks off with Alumnae Tea, where we invite alumnae to visit our house during Ceilidh Weekend and reunite with sisters they sometimes haven&rsquo;t seen in years! Fall semester continues with Crush Party, typically Halloween themed with a costume competition, and our first fundraiser of the year, Anchor Clanker, which consistently provides laughs and good times from participants from all parts of the campus community.<br /> <br /> We dive head first into spring semester, beginning with our annual retreat the first weekend back from winter break. All sisters are encouraged to share their thoughts on how we can continually improve in the coming year.&nbsp;Following retreat, Delta Gamma hosts Anchor Slam, a 5-on-5 basketball tournament that is our annual spring semester fundraising event. The spring also welcomes Delta Gamma Fraternity&rsquo;s Founders Day, where both collegiate and alumni chapters here in Pittsburgh participate in a formal event to celebrate each other, our sisterhood, and our achievements. In addition to the hectic events of Spring Carnival, DG hosts a second Alumnae Tea to connect with and honor the multitude of our sisters who return for CMU&rsquo;s historic event. The year comes to a close with Cream Rose Formal and Senior Sendoff, both which serve as a farewell and good luck to our sisters who will be leaving our school and heading out into the professional world. Although this is the close to our year of events, at this point, planning has already begun for a whole near year of Delta Gamma Events!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>CAMPUS INVOLVEMENT</h3>\r\n<p>We are proud to say our members are involved in...

Today, the fraternity is poised to make a comeback with our re-colonization last year. We are seeking men of the highest calibre to join our group of Founding Fathers, and help progress Delta Upsilon to a premiere fraternity focused on developing members into men based on our principles.</p>\r\n<p><br /> Being a new group, we are in the unique position of having the opportunity and resources to discover our niche on campus and the legacy that we will ultimately leave behind for future generations.

Our main goal is to once again charter officially as a Delta Upsilon chapter and become a permanent installation at Carnegie Mellon.

Founded in 1870, Kappa Alpha Theta is the first Greek-letter Fraternity known among women. Our women are devoted to living Theta&rsquo;s values of service, scholarship, leadership and personal excellence. Being a sister of the Gamma Theta chapter has improved my college experience by providing me with a sisterhood that will last a lifetime.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">Gamma Theta sisters are leaders on campus in service, academic, athletic, and student government organizations. We perform two philanthropy events that benefit our national philanthropy, Court Appointed Special Advocates, as well as the Theta Foundation. We participate in Greek Sing and always build an incredible booth. Besides the campus events we are involved in, we have sisterhood events, crush parties, formals and social events with other organizations on campus.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">As the president, I am proud to call the women of the Gamma Theta chapter my sisters. I invite you to explore our Bridge page, learn more Kappa Alpha Theta, and see all that our chapter has accomplished.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">Loyally,</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">Rebecca Greubel</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">Chapter President</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>General Information</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em>Nationally Founded:</em>&nbsp;January 27th,&nbsp;1870</p>\r\n<p><em>Gamma Theta</em><em>&nbsp;Chapter Founded:</em>&nbsp;April 29th, 1944</p>\r\n<p><em>Colors:</em>&nbsp;Black + Gold</p>\r\n<p><em>Flower:</em>&nbsp;Black and Gold Pansy</p>\r\n<p><em>Symbol:</em>&nbsp;Kite + Twin Stars</p>\r\n<p><em>Motto:</em>&nbsp;\"Faith, hope, love - these three, but the greatest of these is love.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Purpose and Mission</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The intellectual ambition of the Fraternity shall be the attainment of highest scholarship.

Twice a month, Kappa Alpha Theta has sisterhood events such as Theta Thanksgiving, Thetatines, Secret Santa, Spa Night and Cupcake Wars. Outside of sisterhood events, you can be sure to spot sisters studying, eating or just hanging around campus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Service and Philanthropy</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em>Court Appointed Special Advocates</em>,&nbsp;<em>CASA</em>, is Kappa Alpha Theta's national&nbsp;philanthropy. It is central to fulfilling society's most fundamental obligation by making&nbsp;sure a qualified, compassionate adult will fight for and protect a child's right to be safe,&nbsp;to be treated with dignity and respect, and to learn and grow in the security of a loving&nbsp;family. In support of Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), Kappa Alpha Theta&nbsp;endeavors to engage its collegian to provide support for and advancement of court-<br /> appointed volunteer advocacy for abused and neglected children. Since 1989, the&nbsp;Kappa Alpha Theta Foundation has provided grant support and contributed more than&nbsp;$900,000 to CASA.</p>\r\n<p><em>Philanthropy Events</em>: Theta hosts a variety events such as Zumba for CASA, Mr.&nbsp;University, CASA Coffee House, Kicks for CASA, and the CASA 5k in an effort to raise&nbsp;money and awareness for our philanthropy. For Fall 2015, Kappa Alpha Theta is&nbsp;introducing a new signature philanthropy event named Thetathon. Thetathon is a&nbsp;dance &shy;marathon style showcase featuring student DJs, dance troupes and music&nbsp;groups. Free food and raffles will top off a night of talented performers!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Service Activities</em>: Every semester, the sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta dedicate their time&nbsp;to volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania. The Boys and Girls&nbsp;Club is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for youth, with particular emphasis on&nbsp;members who live in urban communities of highly diverse cultures. Theta's also&nbsp;volunteer with Our Clubhouse, a community that supports anyone who has been&nbsp;touched by cancer. In addition, Kappa Alpha Theta participates in Greek Day of Service,&nbsp;1000plus, Relay for Life, and Theta Day of Service.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Scholarship</strong></h2>\r\n<p><em>Minimum Collegiate GPA</em>: 2.7</p>\r\n<p><em>Minimum High School GPA</em>: 3.0</p>\r\n<p><em>Scholarship</em>: To honor the hard work Thetas do, the Scholarship Committee hosts&nbsp;a Scholarship banquet every semester where sisters are recognized for high&nbsp;achievement in their academic endeavors.

Our fraternity motto is: \"To be leaders among men.\"", "description"=>"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Fraternity History</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; was founded in 1981 on the campus of University of California at Los Angeles by Mr. Craig Ishigo, the principal founding father, and eighteen other men. The goal of the fraternity was to transcend the limitations to which traditional Asian American organizations were subject. While traditional Asian campus organizations were often split along lines of national origins, the founders sought an organization that drew its membership equally from the different segments of the Asian American community. Their vision was that the members would eventually bridge the gaps fragmenting the Asian American community through their affiliation with a common organization.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest hurdle in reaching this goal, however, was the membership discontinuity of traditional Asian campus organizations. Student associations provided at best a circle of friends spanning the four years of most undergraduates&rsquo; college experience and at worst a group of familiar strangers encountered during periodic social functions. The yearly turnover of most organizations&rsquo; officers made it nearly impossible to pursue any extended project as each new officer core set its own agenda. The founders&rsquo; solution to this dilemma was the adoption of a fraternal structure. By forming &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; as an Asian-American Interest fraternity, the founders formed a strong bond of brotherhood with each other during their undergraduate experience, and made a commitment to the organization as alumnus even after graduation.</p>\r\n<p>In order to facilitate the process of rapid expansion and to seek standardization throughout the nation, the existing six chapters came together on Memorial Day, 1990, to form what is known as &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; National Fraternity. At this conference, a national governing body was established to better coordinate each individual chapters efforts, a national philanthropy was adopted, national expansion policies implemented and Memorial Day weekend was designated as the official date for the annual convention of &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; National. That fall, with the admittance into the National Interfraternity Council, &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; became the first and only nationally recognized Asian-American Interest Fraternity.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995 to better serve the fraternity as a whole, &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; became a California non-profit corporation. It further divided into two divisions, Alumni and Active, each with its own officer CORPS, policies and procedures.</p>\r\n<p>In the Active division, numerous programs were developed to address the needs of the collegiate brotherhood throughout the nation and abroad. The National Service Program adopted several national philanthropies. The most notable is the Asian American Bone Marrow Donor Program. To date, no other organization in the United States has enlisted more registrants to the Asian bone marrow donor library than &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon;. The National Academic Committee developed guidelines and scholarship programs to encourage academic excellence in our collegiate chapters. The National Expansion Committee developed formal procedures and a fair application process for all interest groups. The creation of the National Brotherhood Program sent national staff members to collegiate chapters to demonstrate different methods of building brotherhood and character. The National Brotherhood Program also established an Annual Brotherhood Showcase, where brothers from around the nation exemplify their understanding of brotherhood through artistic expression.</p>\r\n<p>The alumni Division has also become a large part of &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; National activities. Like the Active Division, the Alumni Division has its own officer CORPS and regions, including an international region in Japan. Regional Alumni Associations hold events, such as professional and community events, as well as, events which allow interaction between the active and alumni members.</p>\r\n<p>Today, there are thousands of brothers in the United States and throughout the world. &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; National Fraternity continues to strive to achieve its motto, &ldquo;To Be Leaders Among Men,&rdquo; by providing services to assist brothers in achieving their fullest potential. Our Active Division continues to teach young men principles of leadership and strong moral character. Our Alumni Division then provides a forum in which brothers may apply these beliefs and become true leaders of their communities. Ultimately, it is the principles of &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; that will inspire all brothers to lead their communities to a better, brighter way of life.</p>\r\n<p>The fraternal structure has allowed &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; to perennially maintain the leadership and quality of membership so that we may be able to meet our status quo as well as continually better ourselves as students and members of our society. With many social and service events planned throughout the year, we invite everyone to check out what &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; has to offer. As you may already know, college is not only about improving your mind but also about personal growth and establishing oneself as an individual. Let &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; help you in providing those resources.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Chapter History</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; at Carnegie Mellon University was established on March 24, 2002 by seventeen ambitious young men.</p>\r\n<p>Frustrated with the fragmented Asian community in Carnegie Mellon University, the Tsung brothers in the summer of 2001 contacted several close friends in hopes of unifying the community by bringing &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; to Carnegie Mellon University. Inspired by Simon/Beeker&rsquo;s (Alpha Alpha) presentation, BAM (Brotherhood of Asian-American Men) was created to do what the many student associations couldn&rsquo;t do: satisfy the student body&rsquo;s short-term interests while achieving the long-term goals of a community. Initially led by a group of close friends, BAM sought to accomplish this task by bringing &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; &ndash; a nation-wide Asian interest fraternity &ndash; to Carnegie Mellon University. Organized by the original members and a few recent additions BAM quickly gained momentum with their first party HeatWave. The concept of a fraternity based on the ideals of brotherhood was more than compelling; soon fourteen other students joined BAM. The trips to Buffalo&rsquo;s annual Halloween Party and Penn State&rsquo;s Spin help fuel their determination. The group of nineteen men each believed that, despite the many setbacks, &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; encompassed many of their own ideals: strength in friendship and more importantly, strength and love in brotherhood.</p>\r\n<p>Working together, their tireless efforts were rewarded when the reverent Penn State University &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; (Tau Chapter) agreed to take on the nineteen pledges, led by Pledge Master Michael &ldquo;Covergirl&rdquo; Wong. The grueling nine-week affair took its toll, and not before long the pledge class was unfortunately reduced to 17 members. Nevertheless, their ambition was only surpassed by their sense of dedication. The idea of being a charter member was the proverbial light at the end of the long and arduous tunnel that is pledging. In fact, the Carnegie Mellon &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; can now boast the largest charter class in the recent history of &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon;. It was 2:04 in the afternoon of March 24th, when the seventeen men crossed into Eternal Brotherhood. Witnessed by the brothers of Tau Chapter, their bond was molded and forged by the very foundations of a brotherhood: trust and sacrifice. The journey was long and hard, but they finally succeeded. The seventeen remaining were no longer a class of pledges or a group of friends who shared a common goal. They were now the seventeen founding fathers of the Carnegie Mellon chapter of &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon;, leaders among men. The goal they so fervently labored for &ndash; the title and respect that comes only with crossing was finally achieved. So what had held the seventeen individuals together for nine hellish weeks will now hold them forever together.</p>\r\n<p>As stated best by a CMU alumnus &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a clique. It&rsquo;s not a crew. It&rsquo;s not your boys back home. It&rsquo;s not a social crutch, a result of some complex or an answer to your insecurities. It&rsquo;s not a best friend, because you don&rsquo;t even have to be friends. It&rsquo;s not someone to eat lunch with, because they don&rsquo;t even have to be there all the time. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;I got your back, no matter what.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s family. It&rsquo;s respect. It&rsquo;s love. It&rsquo;s Eternal Brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Headed by ex-president Darren &lsquo;El Baggo Crappo&rsquo; Chan since 2002, CMU &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; is driven by their dedication and love for the CMU community. Throughout the years, the brothers take part in many cultural and service events on campus, ranging from the annual Culture Night and Asian Heritage Week to Greek Week and Carnival Weekend. Their talents are almost as varied as their personalities; CMU &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; has a unique mix of men of distinctive abilities. Now with a solid foundation after crossing fifteen classes and over 100 brothers, &Lambda;&Phi;&Epsilon; at CMU has a bright future.</p>\r\n</div>", "email"=>"president@cmulambdas.com", "externalWebsite"=>"http://www.cmulamdbas.com", "facebookUrl"=>"http://www.facebook.com/CMULFE", "youtubeChannelUrl"=>"", "profileImageUrl"=>"https://images.collegiatelink.net/clink/images/87f180a9-e80f-4bde-8a0c-fe73c3b1a39771b4fffe-0009-4842-bf2b-9741b73a0fb6.jpg?preset=med-sq", "profileUrl"=>"thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/lambdaphiepsilon", "primaryContactName"=>"", "primaryContactCampusEmail"=>""}, {"organizationId"=>160822, "name"=>"Mellon FIT", "shortName"=>"", "summary"=>"The purpose of Mellon FIT is to provide opportunities for healthy lifestyles to students, faculty, and staff that study, research, and ", "description"=>"<p>Mellon FIT is a collaborative grass-roots organization begun by PhD students in the Chemistry and Biology departments.

The lectures will be patterned after Randy Pausch&rsquo;s Last Lecture: &ldquo;What advice on life do you have for young people?&rdquo; as well as identifying the pitfalls for young writers. Creative writing majors will have modern icons available to answer their questions. The afternoon writing workshops will educate young writers on the business of writing and how to protect themselves and their work as well as introduce them to local, approachable YA authors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2.) Students will benefit from learning how to obtain outside funding for projects that are valuable to the CMU community. Sustainability in planning is important. Students will benefit from having new network contacts and developing grant writing skills.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3.) Key coordinator Barb Carlson (an Administrative Coordinator for the CMU Tepper School of Business) is a writer and the Parsec co-founder. She&rsquo;s looking forward to promoting the many projects Parsec has among the undergraduate and graduate students at CMU and encouraging the students to publish original fiction in the field. Parsec&rsquo;s mission is developing literacy through the promotion of science fiction and fantasy and has special programs aimed at young writers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4.)Have Librarians in the Carnegie Library system support us by informing us about their most popular authors of YA speculative fiction and advertising the YA Lecture Series at the main branch and local branches. In return, their patrons will connect CMU with education and high quality literary entertainment, while they share the thrill of meeting favorite authors. Libraries do not have the large facilities necessary to hold a popular author lecture.</p>\r\n<p>5.) YA speculative fiction has moral messaging. The traditional YA themes are family and fitting in, friendship, first love, insecurity of body image and coming of age. The best books can teach universal truths and improve lives. We should strive to reward a love of reading and writing by offering the opportunity to connect with others with the same passions. CMU is understandably stressful for students; this is a healthy opportunity to relax and enjoy while embracing the universal appeal of a good story. Reading for pleasure is a blissful method of reducing stress and should be encouraged in the members of our campus community.</p>\r\n<p>6.) We believe that CMU students are readers and would love to talk to their favorite authors. Rarely do the other popular lecture series in Pittsburgh invite science fiction and fantasy authors. Okay, once. On November 14, 2012, YA speculative fiction author Neil Gaiman sold out the Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland (which seats 1950) as part of the Pittsburgh Arts and Lecture Series. That is the ultimate goal, to build the lecture series to invite Neil Gaiman back to Pittsburgh to fill seats in the new facility soon to be under construction. &nbsp;</p>", "email"=>"", "externalWebsite"=>"", "facebookUrl"=>"", "youtubeChannelUrl"=>"", "profileImageUrl"=>"https://images.collegiatelink.net/clink/images/f86c7e25-0762-46ad-ae10-aa875d20ce102635895c-1770-48fc-9001-e6667fb04cd5.png?preset=med-sq", "profileUrl"=>"thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/PSF", "primaryContactName"=>"Stephanie O'Neil", "primaryContactCampusEmail"=>"soneil@andrew.cmu.edu"}, {"organizationId"=>64521, "name"=>"Phi Delta Theta", "shortName"=>"Phi Delt", "summary"=>"http://phideltcmu.org/\r\n\r\nPhi Delta Theta PA Rho", "description"=>"<p>Phi Delta Theta was built on three pillars that haven&rsquo;t budged an inch since the Fraternity was founded by &ldquo;The Immortal Six&rdquo; way back in 1848 at Miami University.
